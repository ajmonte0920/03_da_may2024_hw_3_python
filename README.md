HW 3 (Python) for Data Science Bootcamp

In this homework assignment, I used python script to analyze and provide specific summary outputs (written to a file in a specific folder) for financial records of a company and records of a voting poll. 

I referenced in-class activity material to help develop my complete script; and referenced the professors example to help write the specific portion of script that outputs the candidate information in the PyPoll analysis.
